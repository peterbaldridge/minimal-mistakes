### Welcome to my blog. 

I'm a Seattle-based Data Scientist. I created this blog to showcase a few of the smaller analytics projecs that I've had the pleasure of working on.

### More about me:

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Washington with a passion for travelling, digital solutions, and data science. I am particularly interested in random forests and the ways that deep neural networks can be optimized, so as to minimize their paramater-tuning time.
