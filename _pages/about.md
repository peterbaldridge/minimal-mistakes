### Welcome to my blog. 

I'm a Seattle-based data scientist. I created this blog to share a few of my analytics projects that I'm most proud of.

### More about me:

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Washington with a passion for learning, travelling, and data science. I'm particularly interested in random forests and the optimization of deep neural networks.
